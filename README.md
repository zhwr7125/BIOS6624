# bios6624-zhwr7125
Here are what I have done:
    1. Downloaded Github Desktop version and Gitkraken
        (The Github link from CANVAS does not work on my computer)
    2. Created a temporary repository, 
        Modified the test repository's readme.md file,
        Saved, staged and committed the file,
        Tested pushing and pulling the file to github,
        Deleted the repository in gitkraken and github website
    3. Clone the BIOS6624Class and BIOS6624-zhwr7125, 
        copying the folders from BIOS6624Class to BIOS6624-zhwr7125,
        Committed, pushed, and verified
    4. Type a line into the readme.md in the Project0 
        in the code folder in the BIOS6624-zhwr7125, committed, pushed
    5. I did not edit in the browser at github.com. 
        All files can be locally modified, saved, committed, and pushed to the website.
